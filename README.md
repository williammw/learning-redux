# Redux
redux serves to construct the Application State
react provide view the state only

# React-redux 
react and redux are no relation and only through react-reduc (connect)
and get connection 

# Reducer 
* just a piece of function return application state
* value of state created by reducer
* application state is generated by reducer
```
    /reducer
        /index.js <- reducer 之母! 用 {combineReducer} 裝你自己創作嘅 reducer
        /greeting_reducer.js <- nothing inside, just an array (example) return whatever its call
```
# Action and Action Creator
1. Action Creator retuen an action
1. Action is an object just oject flow flow all Reducer
1. Reducer can then use tat action to produce a differnet value for particlar piece of sate

``` import {bindActionCreators} from 'redux'; ``` 
* make sure the action generated by action creator actually ends up flowing through all the different reducer



### container 
* got reducer function and by using 'connect' all reducer response would become props inside the container
* define mapStateToProps 

### action creator
* a button click would triggle a action creator
* action creator is a function return action (object)
    * object send to all reducer inside the application
    * Reducer can choose depending on the action to return different piece of state depending on what action is
        * return state get piped into the application state then pumped back into react application which cause all components to {re-render}


# step 
* create reducer (just return data), 
* combineReducer
* creeate container (upgrade from component)
    * container is component that has direct access to the stats produced by redux through 'react-redux'
* redux 'connect' takes a function and component and produce a container

``` 
mapStateToProp(state) 
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(container)
```
* redux generated a state object then mapped that stae as props to our component becoz the state was upadted through
